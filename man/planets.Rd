\description{

  Data on planets outside the Solar System.

}
\usage{data("planets")}
\format{
  A data frame with 101 observations from 101 exoplanets 
  on the following 3 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{mass}{Jupiter mass of the planet.}
    \item{period}{period in earth days.}
    \item{eccen}{the radial eccentricity of the planet.}
  }
}
\details{

    From the properties of the exoplanets found up to now it        
    appears that the theory of planetary development constructed    
    for the planets of the Solar System may need to be reformulated.
    The exoplanets are not at all like the nine local planets that
    we know so well. A first step in the process of understanding
    the exoplanets might be to try to classify them with respect 
    to their known properties.
