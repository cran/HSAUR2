\usage{data("epilepsy")}
\format{
  A data frame with 236 observations on the following 6 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{treatment}}{the treatment group, a factor with levels \code{placebo}
          and \code{Progabide}.}

                         \code{1} to \code{4}.}

\details{

  In this clinical trial, 59
  patients suffering from epilepsy were randomized to groups receiving either 
  the anti-epileptic drug Progabide or a placebo in addition to 
  standard chemotherapy. The numbers of seizures suffered in each 
  of four, two-week periods were recorded for each patient along 
  with a baseline seizure count for the 8 weeks prior to being 
  randomized to treatment and age. The main question of interest 
  is whether taking progabide reduced the number of epileptic seizures  
  compared with placebo.
